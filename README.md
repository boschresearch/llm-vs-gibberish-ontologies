# Do LLMs Really Adapt to Domains?

Code of paper: Do LLMs Really Adapt to Domains? An Ontology Learning Perspective  (ISWC 2024)

## Description

This repository contains the code for the experiments in the paper. The code is split into two repositories, unified by this main repository for convenience:
- [`wordnet-gibberish`](./wordnet-gibberish/): Contains the code for creating synthetic datasets from WordNet ontologies, by replacing the lexical forms with gibberish.
- [`finetune-llm-ontology`](./finetune-llm-ontology/): Contains the code for evaluating and fine-tuning LLMs on WordNet ontologies (including the datasets created by the `wordnet-gibberish` package).

Please refer to the README files in each repository for more information.
